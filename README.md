# Node Revision History

This simple utility provides a quick way for admin to review 
the number of revisions stored in the system for individual 
nodes and to delete some or all of them.


## Status

This is an initial release of a module written for Backdrop when
the author was faced with the task of tidying up a site that was
over seven years old and had originated in Drupal.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
  
  
## Configuration and use

No initial configuration is needed. 
The module adds an item 'Node Revision History' to the admin 'Content' menu.
